# Learning Representation Through Self-Supervised Learning on Real Gravitational Lensing Images
This repository contains the code for my ongoing project with <a href = "https://ml4sci.org"> Machine Learning for Science (ML4Sci)</a> as part of the <a href = "https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024">Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024</a>. The work done as part of this project is summarized in this <a href="https://iyersreehari.github.io/gsoc24-blog-deeplense-ssl/">blog post</a>

This project focuses on evaluating of self-supervised learning techniques with Transformers utilizing real-world strong gravitational lensing dataset. The learned representations are then evaluated on the downstream task to classify lens and non-lens images. <br>

Before training, download the lenses dataset from <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JHEQFgyGedSm0pVfYH66cHmYOqlqm992?usp=sharing"> drive </a> and the nonlenses dataset from <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11vdOCZKp3tt-Ls-1d8xIfoXgyuLmL9S9?usp=sharing"> drive </a> and place them in lenses and nonlenses subdirectories respectively. <br>
The dataset contains 1949 lens images and 2000 non-lens images. Each image has 3 channels, g, r and i, corresponding to green, red and infrared filters respectively. The images are center cropped to 32 Ã— 32 pixel as this empirically resulted in better prediction accuracy. The models are evaluated on a 15% held out test split of the dataset.<br>
To understand how well SSL works with different fractions of labelled and unlabelled data, the models are pre-trained through self supervision on the entire data and then finetuned on the labelled fraction and compared with supervised baseline trained only on that labeled fraction. <br>

# Supervised Learning Baseline
Following is the evaluation results for supervised baselines computed over a held-out test dataset.

# Self-Supervised Learning 

To run self supervised training, clone this repository and create a config file with the experiment parameters. The config file is expected to be a .yaml file. <br>
Examples of the config files are provided in the <a href="https://github.com/iyersreehari/DeepLense_SSL_Sreehari_Iyer/tree/main/configs"> configs </a> folder.
Update the `data path` field in the config file with the path to the dataset downloaded previously.
Currently, ViT-S and ViT-B for the backbone and DINO and iBOT algorithms for self supervised training have been implemented

Inside the directory, install the required packages.

        pip install -r requirements.txt

The specified network can then be trained through self-supervision as follows:

        python ./ssl/ssltrain.py /path/to/config/file

For self-supervised learning, the ViT backbone is trained on the training dataset without the label information. The hyperparameters are chosen such that the K-NN accuracy computed over the representations obtained for the validation dataset is maximized. For evaluating the learned network, the backbone followed by a linear classifier is finetuned on the train dataset (with label information) and then evaluated over the held-out test dataset. The trained models are saved in the output directory specified in the config file.<br>

The pretrained models can then be fine-tuned with the labeled dataset. The indices list for different count of labeled data is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/iyersreehari/DeepLense_SSL_Sreehari_Iyer/tree/main/input"> input </a> folder.
The notebooks in the <a href="https://github.com/iyersreehari/DeepLense_SSL_Sreehari_Iyer/tree/main/notebooks"> notebooks </a> folder provide examples for fine-tuning the pre-trained models.<br>
